# CO-PO Assessment System

## Overview

The **CO-PO Assessment System** is a comprehensive educational management platform designed to track, measure, and analyze **Course Outcomes (CO)** against **Program Outcomes (PO)** in academic institutions. This JavaFX-based desktop application provides a robust solution for educational institutions to monitor student performance, assess curriculum effectiveness, and ensure alignment with program objectives according to accreditation standards.

Developed for the **Islamic University of Technology (IUT)**, this system facilitates outcome-based education (OBE) assessment and reporting for faculty and administrators.
